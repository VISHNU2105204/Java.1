/*Practical13 : Write a program should generate a random number between 1 and 100,
and then ask the user to guess the number. If the userâ€™s guess is too high or too low,
the program should give them a hint and let them try again. The program should
keep track of how many guesses the user has made, and end when the user has
guessed the number correctly*/
